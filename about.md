a 'dumb' emotional device

Is there a way that social media could facilitate meetings in real life, or prompt a phone call, to go beyond the screen?

A subset of the Internet of Things is "the Internet of Emotions". There is increasing use of technology to infer what our 'emotional state' is, through trackers, face analysis etc. From a step-counting device knowing how active you are, may infer how happy you are. It might be 'helpful' to get a prompt to be more active. However, it may be invasive. The use of this data is problematical, as this is at the behest of the company that designs the trackers, and the algorithms that they use. Because we aren't in control the smarts, the smarts might be in control of us.

Even well intentioned apps designed by charities can have unintentional consequences. [http://www.samaritans.org/how-we-can-help-you/supporting-someone-online/samaritans-radar was one problematical example. "Samaritans Radar was an online app designed to offer people a second chance to see a tweet from someone they know who might be struggling to cope." It was up for only under 10 days before it was deleted following outcry from its users over " concerns raised by Twitter users at the time of launch, regarding data protection and privacy issues." Basically knowing that this app existed might make those people more vulnerable.]

Taking this as a 'bad example' could we do better over a related issue of loneliness. To give ownership over what we broadcast and narrowcast. What about if there was a 'dumb' device that can be used/customised by yourself, that would let trusted people/friends know how you are. A device that with a twist of a dial could say on your behalf that: you are lonely or happy or in a good place, or wanting a phone call?

The piece will be presented as a physical sketch, a microcontroller + button as a work in progress. It would be good to workshop during the meeting, whether it is a good idea, whether it could be made better, how it might communicate. Getting the bursary will allow me to develop it, to make a physical object and to present it.
